Part 1: 2

Q1. Briefly explain the clock path from start to finish (crystal to SYSCLK), including explanations for all your major register configurations.

Clock path setting:
step1. 8MHz(choose HSE as the output of PLLSRCMUX)  => Choose RCC_CFGR_PLLFRC
step2. 8MHz * 9 = 72Mhz(set PLLMUL to 9)            => Choose RCC_CFGR_PLLMUL9
step3. 72Mhz(choose PLLCLK as the output of SW MUX) => Choose RCC_CFGR_SW_PLL
step4. SYSCLK = 72Mhz

Besides then, we set the AHB prescaler, APB1 prescaler and APB2 Prescaler as /1, /2, /1,
respectively (choose RCC_CFGR_HPRE_DIV1, RCC_CFGR_PPRE1_DIV2,RCC_CFGR_PPRE2_DIV1)

We also need to enable PLL by setting RCC_CR_PLL, and set flash to two wait states.

Part 2: 3

Q2. Describe how you determined your PWM frequency.

We choose to use PWM mode1. The PWM frequency is determined by the TIMx_PSC and the TIMx_ARR register, which is TIMxCLK/TIMx_PSC/TIMx_ARR.

Q3. Describe how you would calculate CCR1 values for motors off, %50, and %100.

In PWM mode 1, the reference PWM signal OCxREF is high as long as TIMx_CNT<TIMx_CCRx. Thus,the percentage of time the motor is on is 
TIMx_CCRx/(TIMx_ARR+1)*100%, and the precentage of time the motor is off is 1-TIMx_CCRx/(TIMx_ARR+1)*100%, for motor's off, 50%, 100%,
We have : 

duty cycle     TIMxCCRx
0              0
50%            (TIMx_ARR+1)/2
100%           TIMx_ARR+1
